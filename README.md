Tron Light Cycle Framework for Entelect Challenge - for use in conjunction with TronLCSim (http://www.github.com/sschocke/tron-lc-simulator)

IAIBot Interface Details
=================
The IAIBot Interface has a single method called "ExecuteMove" with the following signature:

void ExecuteMove(string gameStateFile);

This method gets called by the simulator each time it is your bots turn to move. The "gameStateFile" parameter contains the path to the game.state file generated by the simulator for the current state of the game from your point of view. In this regard, the "ExecuteMove" method works identically to the way the bots should work for the Entelect challenge, except that the path is passed via this function call instead of via the command line.
